            <h3>Who we are</h3>

            <p>GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over five million people use GitHub to build amazing things together. With the collaborative features of GitHub.com, our desktop and mobile apps, and GitHub Enterprise, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write better code, faster.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/features/projects">We have a lot of exciting things to do</a>, and we’re looking for the right people to grow with us!</p>

            <h3>Why you should join</h3>

            <p>Working at GitHub is, to put it simply, a special slice of the universe. We're committed to transparency, collaboration, experimentation, and always staying classy. </p>

            <p>Because of this unique perspective, we've established one of the most flexible and well designed physical workspaces around that encourages you to work as you work best. Right now, over 60% of our employees are based outside of our San Francisco (SOMA) headquarters and work according to how they get their best stuff done. Remote GitHubbers also come visit SF often and are encouraged to stay as long as they like!   </p>

            <p>Ensuring that GitHubbers are healthy, motivated, focused and creative is how GitHub stays awesome. Part of this is ensuring that our <a href="https://github.com/about/jobs">benefits</a> are out of this world.</p>

            <p>In a nutshell, we've built and are growing a place where we truly love working, and we think you will too.</p>

            <p><em>GitHub is made up of people with many different backgrounds and lifestyles, and we like it that way. We invite applications from people of all stripes. We don't discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences that people imagine to discriminate against one another.
